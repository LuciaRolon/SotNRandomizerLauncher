# Symphony of the Night Randomizer Launcher

Welcome! The Symphony of the Night Randomizer Launcher is a tool made to simplify your randomizer experience. This all-in-one tool provides you with everything you need to start playing the randomizer. No need to follow guides or anything, just install the Launcher, let it download the Emulator (BizHawk), the timer (LiveSplit), and the tools to get you playing. [Download the latest version here, from GitHub releases!](https://github.com/LuciaRolon/SotNRandomizerLauncher/releases)

## Features

- **Automatic Updates**: Let the launcher handle Rando Tools, LiveSplit and BizHawk for you. As soon as a new update for these tools is available, the Launcher will allow you to update them.
- **PPF Patcher**: Just choose your seed file (PPF), press Play and you're playing the randomizer. No configuration required!
- **Default Settings**: No need to setup the Autosplitter or the emulator. Everything comes configured. You don't even have to select the ROM!
- **Randomizer**: Generate your own seeds from any of the presets that have been developed by our community. Generate your PPF, patch it into the game, and play!
- **News Feed**: Keep up with the latest community news, like the Next Event and the current Seed of the Week. Wanna know more about the community? [Join us at the Long Library Discord!](https://discord.gg/7c22uzVgFE "Join us at the Long Library Discord!")

## Requirements
- [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481 ".NET Framework 4.8.1").
- [BizHawk Requirements](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk-Prereqs/blob/2.4.8_1/dist/info.txt "BizHawk Requirements"). Most of these requirements should normally be installed by your computer, as they're common tools. But in case you're having issues running BizHawk, here you have the list.
- Internet Connection (during Setup).


## FAQ / Common Issues

- My computer/browser says it's not a trusted file. Is this a virus?

No. There're two reasons why your computer thinks that: one, the Launcher has been recently released and is not yet trusted by all systems, and two, the Launcher interacts with files on your computer to generate the random preset, which falsely flags it as an untrusted application. The code within the Launcher is here, publicly available, so you can see there's no viruses in sight. If you get the SmartScreen message ("Windows protected your PC"), just press "More info", then the "Run" button will appear.

- Where can I get a PPF file to use with the Launcher?

Within the Long Library Discord we have a friendly bot called the TinManBot. You can ask it to generate a seed using the `/generate` command. But this does not include all presets. You can find a generator for the rest of the presets online at [sotn.io](https://sotn.io/ "sotn.io"). Some presets are only available with the TinManBot, and others are only available within sotn.io. You can find more info on the randomizer at [SymphonyRando](https://www.symphonyrando.fun/ "SymphonyRando").

- Can I change the settings within LiveSplit/BizHawk?

Yes! Once the Launcher finished installing, the tools are up to you. You can change any settings you want within the different tools, so you can customize the experience to your own preferences.

- I already play the randomizer and have customized many options within my BizHawk/LiveSplit. Can I keep them?

Yes! For experienced players you can choose to import your current installation of BizHawk and LiveSplit and use them instead of the ones provided by the Launcher. The only important thing here is that using your own install will disable Automatic Updates, to ensure the Launcher doesn't mess with your important settings. You can find the randomized seed within the Launcher folder at `files/randomized`.

- I have an issue / I don't understand one of the Launcher's features. How can I get any help?

You can upload your issue or question through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LuciaRolon/SotNRandomizerLauncher/issues "GitHub Issues"). I'll try to answer it as soon as possible. You can also ask within the #randomizer channel at the Long Library Discord. We have an active community open to help any new players with all Randomizer-related stuff.

- Does the Launcher include the game?

No. Distributing the game is not allowed. Please, don't ask for it through issues or the Long Library Discord. You can probably find it online. The Launcher will tell you what is needed to play during setup.
